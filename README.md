## Case Study

'__Stepping into History__’ is a fast-growing business that offers the history enthusiast
something a little bit different. Through its website and attendance at various events,
the company promotes the following services and products:
 Guided tours of famous historical sites, buildings and battlefields – across the
world
- Customized expert lectures from world-renowned historians for private functions
- Genealogical research and family tree services – either face-to-face or remotely
- Historical documents and books location service – from across the world
- Historical book sales – from its own on-line book store
- History magazine subscriptions – issued quarterly in hardcopy and e-copyformat
- Hands-on training workshops and courses – in historical and archaeological skills
 
The company needs a database to run the company – your job is to deliver that database. For
each aspect of the business you must identify and capture the relevant data – such as speaker
details, customer details, lecture/visit dates and locations, book details, workshop details etc.
etc.

The above is simply an outline of the company and you will need to make your own
assumptions and interpret or even extend the scenario as you go. Use your imagination as
you see fit but you must clearly document all assumptions and extensions.
